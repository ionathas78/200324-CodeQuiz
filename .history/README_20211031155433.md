# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

> I wanted to make a fun game to quiz students on JavaScript essentials.
> This is my result.

I wanted to make a dynamic, mobile-responsive quiz game that would have exciting rules, where the 
question / answer set would be completely modular and independent of the game code. Ideally, I 
wanted to implement different levels of difficulty that would have different start times and 
point schedules, with separate high score tables for each level. I didn't have quite enough time 
to code that. Maybe next time...

## User Story

```
AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Design Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
```
